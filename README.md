# Bartender boilerplate for Harp

Bartender is a Sass and EJS based boilerplate. Specifically it uses [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) from [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/).

## Usage
Once you have Harp installed, using Bartender is super easy. All you have to do is init a new project using the `--boilerplate` or `-b` flag.

```
harp init myproject --boilerplate jordanjustice/hb-bartender
```
