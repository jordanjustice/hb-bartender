# Bartender boilerplate for Harp

Bartender is a Sass and EJS based boilerplate. Specifically it uses Bourbon and Neat from thoughtbot.

## Usage
Once you have Harp installed, using Bartender is super easy. All you have to do is init a new project using the `--boilerplate` or `-b` flag.

```
harp init myproject --boilerplate jordanjustice/hb-bartender
```
